    "Hello everyone, this assignment notebook covers Tree-Based Models. There are some code-completion tasks and question-answering tasks in this answer sheet. For code completion tasks, please write down your answer (i.e., your lines of code) between sentences that \"Your code starts here\" and \"Your code ends here\". The space between these two lines does not reflect the required or expected lines of code. For answers in plain text, you can refer to [this Markdown guide](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/the-ultimate-markdown-guide-for-jupyter-notebook-d5e5abf728fd) to customize the layout (although it shouldn't be needed).\n",

Note that the method returns not the values themselves but the indices of the values. By giving you this method, we can ensure that everyone should get the exact same result, as well as that the results will match with the Decision Tree implementation of scikit-learn. For example, `create_split()` puts all samples `<=` then the threshold into the left child node (and all others into the right child node).

The outliers can lead to a biased model, because the decision tree will try to minimize the RSS score, which is affected by the outliers. If leaf node contains outliers, the predicted value will be biased.\n",

These metrics are less sensitive to outliers than RSS score. The outliers will not affect the split as much as in regression.\n",

However, MAE is less efficient to compute than RSS score. The downside is that the model will be less efficient to train and predict. Another way to handle outliers is to use ensemble methods, such as random forest or gradient boosting. These methods can reduce the impact of outliers by averaging the predictions of multiple trees.

    "1. When using Bagging, the feature selection at the root node focuses on a few specific features (such as index 1 and 5), indicating that these features have strong predictive power for the target variable across the entire dataset. When using Bagging + Feature Sampling, the feature selection at the root node is more dispersed, with different trees' root nodes using different features. This reflects the randomness introduced by feature sampling, resulting in different structures for each tree, which helps to enhance the diversity of the model.\n",
    "2. The number of nodes in trees using Bagging + Feature Sampling is usually slightly higher. This may be because, in the case of Bagging + Feature Sampling, each tree can only use a subset of features for splitting, limiting the options available to create the optimal split. As a result, the trees may grow deeper to compensate for the lack of information. This phenomenon indicates that Bagging + Feature Sampling may lead to a more complex tree structure in order to capture the patterns in the data."

    "1. In the Bagging-only tree structure for classification tasks, the root node features are mainly concentrated on feature indices 2 and 3. This indicates that these features may be more important in distinguishing different categories in classification problems. When using Bagging + Feature Sampling, the feature selection at the root node becomes more dispersed, sometimes even using feature index 0 as the root node, which is rare in the case of Bagging only. This diversity of features helps to improve the robustness of the classification model, as it allows each tree to focus on different features.\n",
    "2. In classification tasks, the number of nodes in trees during Bagging + Feature Sampling varies significantly, with some trees having a notably higher number of nodes compared to Bagging only (for example, node counts reaching 57 or 61). This indicates that in classification tasks, when feature sampling is used, some features may lead to a more complex tree structure to capture the patterns in the data. This is different from the situation in regression tasks, where the tree structure of Bagging + Feature Sampling, although also complex, does not show such significant differences."

    "\n",
    "In this last part, we look into evaluating different tree-based models using k-fold cross validation. K-fold cross-validation is a technique used in machine learning to assess the performance and generalization ability of a model. It involves dividing the dataset into K subsets (or \"folds\") of equal size. The model is trained on K-1 of these folds and tested on the remaining one. This process is repeated K times, with each fold used as the test set exactly once. The final performance metric is computed by averaging the results from each iteration. K-fold cross-validation helps ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data, reducing the risk of overfitting or underfitting.\n",

    "1. DecisionTreeRegressor: The shortest runtime, as it only trains one tree, resulting in lower computational overhead. RandomForestRegressor: Moderate runtime. Since multiple trees need to be trained (each tree is trained independently), it takes longer compared to a single decision tree, but can be accelerated through parallel processing. GradientBoostingRegressor: The longest runtime, as it adopts a stepwise training approach where the training of each tree depends on the results of the previous trees. Therefore, the computational overhead is greater in each training step.\n",
    "2. DecisionTreeRegressor: When the maximum depth of the tree is small, the model is prone to underfitting, resulting in high training and validation errors. As the depth of the tree increases, the model gradually becomes overfitted, with a significant reduction in training error, but validation error may increase. RandomForestRegressor: Due to the integration of multiple trees, each trained on different samples and subsets of features, the random forest has a strong resistance to overfitting. Even with a large tree depth, the validation error does not easily increase significantly. GradientBoostingRegressor: Gradient boosting regression improves model performance by progressively reducing residuals, but it is also prone to overfitting, especially when the depth of the trees is large. However, due to the presence of the learning rate, the risk of overfitting can be reduced by adjusting the learning rate.\n",
    "3. DecisionTreeRegressor: Under certain parameter settings (such as a smaller tree depth), RMSE can be relatively high, indicating underfitting. As the depth increases, RMSE decreases, but performance on the validation set does not necessarily improve. RandomForestRegressor: Generally performs better than a single decision tree because ensemble methods can average out errors. In general, as the depth of the trees increases, the training error decreases, but the change in validation error is not significant. GradientBoostingRegressor: In most cases, the performance of gradient boosting regression outperforms that of decision trees and random forests, as it can better fit complex patterns by incrementally improving model performance.\n",
    "4. For DecisionTreeRegressor and RandomForestRegressor, when the depth is small, the model is prone to underfitting; as the depth increases, the training error decreases rapidly, but it may lead to overfitting. For GradientBoostingRegressor, due to the method of gradually reducing residuals, it can achieve good performance even with shallow trees. However, when the depth is large, care must be taken to avoid overfitting, and it is usually necessary to adjust the learning rate to achieve optimal results. "
